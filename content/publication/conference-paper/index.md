abstract: This study aims to evaluate whether the addition of Gaussian noise as data augmentation enhances the learning  process or merely introduces irrelevant data ("noise") into the system. The evaluation focuses on how the augmented data affects learning outcomes, particularly in scenarios with increasing noise levels. The study also compares classification performance with and without noise augmentation to assess its impact on model generalization and accuracy. Gaussian noise was applied at six controlled variance levels (0.01 to 0.3), and its influence on classification was analyzed across 1D-CNN and 2DCNN. Statistical analyses using MANOVA and the Kolmogorov Smirnov test confirmed that Gaussian noise augmentation preserved the core structure of the original data at lower noise levels while introducing realistic variability. The results show that for 1D-CNN, Zhou’s architecture consistently achieved 96% accuracy across all noise levels, indicating robustness to added noise. In contrast, 2D-CNN models, particularly ResNet34 with transfer learning, demonstrated exceptional performance at low noise levels (0.01) with an accuracy of 98.66%, but experienced a gradual performance decline as noise levels increased. This research provides insights into the effectiveness of Gaussian noise augmentation for improving model learning and highlights its limitations at higher noise levels. By comparing results with and without noise augmentation, the study demonstrates the importance of noise calibration to maintain the balance between variability and data integrity in classification tasks.
