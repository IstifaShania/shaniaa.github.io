abstract: "The impact of fluoride on human health is still a controversial issue. The World Health Organization (WHO) has provided permissible levels of fluoride in black tea, but various commodities still ignore it. The purpose of this research is to design a software system used to build a predictive model for fluoride concentration based on the Rs / Ro ratio. The system uses input data in the form of e-nose sensor response and uses the Partial Least Square (PLSR) regression method for quick analysis of fluoride levels in various quality black tea (kw1, kw2, kw3). Identification of volatile compounds in black tea with various qualities was carried out using an e-nose equipped with 12 gas sensors. A prediction model for fluoride concentration based on the Rs / Ro ratio was successfully developed for each quality. The predictive performance values of fluoride concentration in the sample against the reference fluoride concentration Rs / Ro are: R2predkw1 = 0.986620 and RMSEpredkw1 = 0.004642; R2predkw2 = 0.994791 and RMSEpredkw2 = 0.010772; R2predkw3 = 0.994054 and RMSEpredkw3 = 0.005324. This shows that the indicators of predictive goodness for each black tea quality are satisfactory."
